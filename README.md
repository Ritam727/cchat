# Chatting App

A simple chatting app made using React js, Node js and Socket.io
To test it in your local system, download the zip file of the repository or clone it to your local system. Then navigate to the directory of the application, and run the following commands to install the required packages:

```
$ cd cchat && npm install
```

```
$ cd ../server && npm install
```

To run the application, open up another terminal window and navigate to the `server` folder inside the cloned repository and run:

```
$ node index.js
```

In another terminal window, navigate to the `cchat` folder inside the repository and run:

```
$ npm start
```

This will start the application at `localhost:3000`.
